This is a technical test provided by FotonTech for the frontend stack.

# Info
The aim of this test was not to only provide what was proposed, but an enviromnent that could both boost reliability, perfomance and speed of development and serve as a base for a big project that could be scaled. I developed an unique architecture that is simple yet powerful by it's design, easily able to handle a multitude of use cases and different project scopes. If you have any doubt or want to know more about this architecture, you can call me and I will be glad to make this community a better place.

## Technologies
- react
- redux
- vite
- rematch (redux plugin)
- @acai (router/stubber)
- bootstrap, fontawesome
- nuka-carousel, react-router, html-react-parser, faker, react-infinite-scroll-component

## Extra
- localization
- service schema (with classes and decorators)
- robust route building
- stub system for creating files
- dynamic background generation
